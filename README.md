# CyberFlow: Interactive Flow-Based Programming

Transforms various cybersecurity operations into a user-friendly interface by utilizing an interactive flow-based programming model

Designed by Casey Abrego, Kyle Chan, Michael Rojas, and Jared Olalde 

Written in Python 3 and JavaScript.

Project begun January 2025.

## Project Scope
